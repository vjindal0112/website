    <h2>Lessons</h2>
    <p>Some things I've learned</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You will never always feel incredible. Don‚Äôt over-optimize your life around feeling incredible, over-optimize
        your life to perform at your best no matter how you are feeling.
      </li>
      <li>There‚Äôs no limit to willpower; there‚Äôs no quota for the day.</li>
      <li>Show up for your friends, always.</li>
      <li>Everyone is still figuring stuff out. No one has their life together, no matter how successful they are. </li>
      <li>Single-minded focus is your superpower. Learn to harness it.</li>
      <li>Inspiration is fleeting, act on it immediately. </li>
      <li>
        The mismatch of how difficult you expect something to be and how hard it is in reality is the source of most
        of your anger and frustration.
      </li>
      <li>Friendship, at its core, is mutual mentorship.</li>
      <li>
        Always assume people are acting in good faith. Even if they aren‚Äôt, your perception and reaction will be more
        true to yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
